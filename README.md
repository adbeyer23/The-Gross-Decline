The Gross Decline: Predicting First to Second Week Box Office Decline

In this project, I built a linear regression and gradient boosted tree models to predict how far a movie would decline at the box office between week 1 and week 2.

My data came from scraping 5500 pages of movie data, with Scrapy, from BoxOfficeMojo.com, and adding in user rating and critic data from OMDB API.
